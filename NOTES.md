  behavior so future changes can validate parity without re-reading the
  notebook.
- **Next step**: Monitor for gaps when drafting the remaining legacy simulator
  documentation tracks.

## 2025-11-05  PR #draft

- **Outcome / Acceptance Criteria**: Confirm `docs/legacy-simulator/flow.md`
  cites the authoritative helper ranges, matches observable behavior in
  `legacy/openai19pm10.py`, and is cross-referenced from TODO.md so the flow
  track can close.
- **Summary**: Plan a verification pass on the flow reference and align TODO.md
  status with the completed documentation.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: A short validation cycle ensures the new flow doc
  remains trustworthy and the work queue reflects reality before continuing
  with parallel documentation tracks.
- **Next step**: Adjust TODO.md to mark the flow track complete and make any
  documentation touch-ups discovered during the verification review.


## 2025-11-06  PR #draft

- **Summary**: Plan documentation of the legacy simulator's runtime inputs and generated artifacts before any refactor.

## 2025-11-07  PR #draft

- **Summary**: Plan a documentation polish pass to capture artifact lifecycle modes, configuration fallbacks, and logging guarantees the initial draft omitted.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Review feedback flagged missing clarity around append vs. overwrite behavior, seeded assets, and how optional configuration defaults behave when uploads are absent; tightening the reference avoids regressions during refactoring.
- **Next step**: Update TODO.md with the targeted documentation fix and revise docs/legacy-simulator/artifacts.md to add an explicit lifecycle matrix, configuration fallback notes, and clearer logging guarantees.
- **Summary**: Documented the lifecycle matrix, configuration fallbacks, and logging guarantees in docs/legacy-simulator/artifacts.md to close the review loop.
- **Stage**: implementation
- **Motivation / Decision**: Ensuring the artifact reference spells out overwrite vs. append behavior and seeded defaults prevents accidental contract changes during refactoring.
- **Next step**: Monitor for additional review feedback while advancing the remaining legacy simulator documentation tracks in parallel.

## 2025-11-08  PR #draft

- **Outcome / Acceptance Criteria**: Document every configuration input that
  steers macro/mini iteration behavior, phase sequencing, and backward
  compatibility toggles so refactors can reproduce the legacy branching logic
  without inspecting code; include default fallbacks and failure modes observed
  in `legacy/openai19pm10.py`.
- **Summary**: Plan documentation capturing the simulator configuration surfaces
  that govern as-is iteration behavior prior to the refactor.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Contributors need a single reference describing how
  `simulation_config.json` and related helpers influence runtime behavior so they
  can validate parity when modernizing the orchestrator.
- **Next step**: Update TODO.md with the configuration documentation work item
  and draft `docs/legacy-simulator/configuration.md` to satisfy the acceptance
  criteria.

## 2025-11-09  PR #draft

- **Outcome / Acceptance Criteria**: All documentation describing the legacy
  simulator lives under `legacy/documentation/**`, repository references point to
  the relocated paths, and no links target `docs/simulation-overview.md` or
  `docs/legacy-simulator/**`.
- **Summary**: Plan to relocate legacy simulator documentation into the
  `legacy/documentation/` tree and retarget internal links while keeping
  non-legacy docs untouched.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Co-locating as-is documentation with the legacy
  assets reduces confusion during the documentation-first phase before
  refactoring.
- **Next step**: Move the files, update references, and adjust TODO.md
  checkpoints accordingly.

## 2025-11-09  PR #draft

- **Summary**: Moved the legacy simulator overview and reference docs into
  `legacy/documentation/`, updated README/TODO links, and confirmed no
  actionable references under `docs/` still point to legacy content.
- **Stage**: implementation
- **Motivation / Decision**: Keeping the as-is documentation beside the legacy
  assets avoids confusion while the refactor is pending and aligns with the
  request to house all legacy material in one place.
- **Next step**: Monitor for stale historical references in NOTES.md that still
  cite the previous `docs/` paths; leave them as archival context per log
  policies.


## 2025-11-10  PR #draft

- **Outcome / Acceptance Criteria**: All active plans and backlog entries
  reference the relocated `legacy/documentation/**` paths, callers know legacy
  docs stay co-located with the code, and cross-references in root guides
  resolve without pointing at the removed `docs/` tree.
- **Summary**: Plan documentation cleanup to realign TODO backlog links and
  repository guidance with the new legacy documentation locations.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Review feedback highlighted stale `docs/`
  references that could misdirect contributors now that the overview and
  simulator docs moved under `legacy/documentation/`.
- **Next step**: Update TODO.md (and any other affected guidance) to reference
  the legacy paths, verify README wording remains accurate, and prepare to mark
  the task complete once the links resolve correctly.

## 2025â€‘01â€‘01Â Â PRÂ #0Â Â ðŸŒ± _file created_

- **Summary**: Seeded repository with starter templates (`AGENTS.md`, `TODO.md`,
  `NOTES.md`) and minimal CI workflow.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: establish collaboration conventions before code.
- **Next step**: set up lint/test commands and begin core featureÂ A.


## 2025-02-14  PR #draft
- **Summary**: Documented legacy artifact inventory and referenced it from the main README.
- **Stage**: implementation
- **Motivation / Decision**: Contributors need a canonical list of immutable legacy assets and clear handling rules.
- **Next step**: None; legacy documentation now centralizes asset guidance.
- **Summary**: Document simulation modes and link overview doc from README.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Need clear documentation of workflows, inputs/outputs, metrics, and known reporting gaps.
- **Next step**: Draft overview doc and update README cross-reference.

## 2025-10-26  PR #draft

- **Summary**: Replace TODO placeholder with structured documentation backlog
  tied to README overhaul, simulation references, and legacy inventory work.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Clarify near-term documentation deliverables and
  ensure TODO items trace back to NOTES plans per repository conventions.
- **Next step**: Execute backlog items in TODO.md, starting with README
  overhaul when capacity allows.

## 2025-10-27  PR #draft

- **Summary**: Refined README and simulation overview to fix typos, remove
  duplicated phrasing, and clarify guardrails for contributors.
- **Stage**: implementation
- **Motivation / Decision**: Earlier docs contained inconsistencies and missing
  guidance that obscured how the simulation behaves and how to work in the repo.
- **Next step**: Monitor documentation for additional gaps as the refactor plan
  evolves.

## 2025-10-28  PR #draft

- **Summary**: Planned a documentation pass to explain the legacy simulator's
  control flow, data inputs, and outputs before refactoring.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: A structured understanding of
  `legacy/openai19pm10.py` and its supporting assets is required to document
  current behavior accurately and derisk later modernization.
- **Next step**: Execute the parallel TODO.md tasks that capture flow,
  configuration, input, and output documentation tracks.

## 2025-10-29  PR #draft

- **Summary**: Deepened the documentation plan by mapping simulator lifecycle
  hooks to their concrete classes, data files, and generated artifacts.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Reviewing `DevOpsSimulation`, `IssueTracker`, and
  related assets exposed specific control points that future docs must cover to
  keep refactors aligned with the legacy behavior.
- **Next step**: Update TODO.md with parallel documentation tracks keyed to the
  identified files (`flow.md`, `templates.md`, `configuration.md`,
  `artifacts.md`, `runtime-log.md`).

## 2025-10-30  PR #draft

- **Summary**: Plan documentation capturing the legacy simulator's observable
  behavior baseline before any refactor.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Need a shared reference describing current
  macro/mini iteration flow, IO contracts, and operational guardrails so
  refactors can verify behavior.
- **Next step**: Author a legacy behavior baseline doc and cross-link it from
  existing guides.


### 2025-10-31  PR #draft
- **Summary**: Outcomes/acceptance criteria established to verify `legacy/documentation/behavior-baseline.md` reflects actual simulator control flow, IO contracts, and guardrails before the refactor.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Need to audit the freshly added baseline doc for factual accuracy and fill observable gaps so future refactors rely on a trustworthy reference.
- **Next step**: Update TODO.md with the verification task, review the code paths, and adjust the baseline documentation accordingly.


## 2025-11-01  PR #draft

- **Summary**: Plan documentation update to capture the current simulator
  inputs, flow, and artifacts before any refactor.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Contributors need a single reference that mirrors
  the legacy implementation so future refactors can compare behavior safely.
- **Next step**: Update `docs/simulation-overview.md` (and linked references) to
  describe the as-is control flow, data hand-offs, and reporting outputs;
  acceptance criteria: overview reflects actual legacy behavior, cites key
  runtime files, and calls out preserved limitations.


## 2025-11-02  PR #draft

- **Summary**: Plan to enrich `docs/simulation-overview.md` so it captures
  observable legacy simulator behavior, referencing control flow, state
  hand-offs, and generated artifacts.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Documenting the as-is implementation with precise
  code touchpoints enables refactors to validate parity and satisfies the
  outstanding overview task.
- **Next step**: Update `docs/simulation-overview.md` to describe
  `run_backcompat_iterations`, `run_phase_based_simulation`, issue/lesson
  propagation, and outputs; accept when the doc cites key functions, state
  storage, and reporting limitations drawn from the current code.

## 2025-11-03  PR #draft
- **Outcome / Acceptance Criteria**: `docs/simulation-overview.md` cites the actual CSV, DOCX, and log filenames used by `setup_documentation()` and `generate_final_summary_doc()` so readers no longer expect timestamped variants.
- **Summary**: Align simulation overview documentation with the concrete file names and rotation behavior in `legacy/openai19pm10.py`.
- **Stage**: planning
- **Motivation / Decision**: Review feedback highlighted mismatches between the documented artifact names and the code paths that emit them, risking confusion during verification runs.
- **Next step**: Update `docs/simulation-overview.md` to match the code defaults (e.g., `iteration_metrics.csv`, `mini_iteration_summary_metrics.csv`, `iteration_summary_metrics.csv`, `output_multi_iter.docx`, `colab_console_output.txt`) and describe overwrite vs. append behavior.

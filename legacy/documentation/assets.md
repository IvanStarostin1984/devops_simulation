# Legacy Asset Inventory

This inventory documents the files under `legacy/` so contributors know how to
handle read-only artifacts and their supporting assets.

## Artifact summary

| Artifact | Location | Format | Role in simulation | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client specifications | `legacy/client_specifications.docx` | DOCX | Source brief describing the product vision and requirements used to seed each simulation run. | Input |
| Artifact template data | `legacy/artifact_data.json` | JSON | Defines every artifact/table schema, dependencies, trace columns, and review prompts consumed by the simulator. | Input |
| Simulation configuration | `legacy/simulation_config.json` | JSON | Provides phase sequencing, iteration counts, and mode flags that tune simulator behaviour. | Input |
| Colab execution notebook export | `legacy/openai19pm10.py` | Python script | End-to-end Colab workflow that orchestrates the DevOps simulation, loads inputs, calls OpenAI, and writes all outputs. | Dependency |
| Console capture | `legacy/colab_console_output - 2025-10-26T134021.847.txt` | TXT | Timestamped log of the Colab session capturing package installs and runtime output for traceability. | Output |
| Macro-iteration metrics | `legacy/iteration_summary_metrics - 2025-10-26T134010.033.csv` | CSV | Aggregated statistics for each macro iteration (timings, complexity, defect density, carry-over counts). | Output |
| Mini-iteration metrics | `legacy/mini_iteration_summary_metrics - 2025-10-26T134010.034.csv` | CSV | Fine-grained metrics per phase mini-iteration, including churn, coverage, and gap tallies. | Output |
| Issue lifecycle register | `legacy/issue_lifecycle - 2025-10-26T134010.034.csv` | CSV | Tracks each detected gap across iterations with severity, recurrence, and resolution timing. | Output |
| Multi-iteration deliverable | `legacy/output_multi_iter - 2025-10-26T134010.034.docx` | DOCX | Compiled artifact package generated by the simulator across all iterations. | Output |
| Review feedback package | `legacy/teacher_review_output_multi_iter - 2025-10-26T134010.034.docx` | DOCX | Collected reviewer feedback and teacher critiques corresponding to the generated deliverables. | Output |

current snapshot and new runs will emit fresh, timestamped copies alongside the
existing ones.

## Dependencies and usage instructions

- Launch the legacy workflow by uploading `openai19pm10.py` to Google Colab and
  executing the `orchestrate_process()` cell.
- Before running, ensure the following supporting files are present in the
  Colab session storage:
  - `client_specifications.docx` (required) – provides the client brief.
  - `artifact_data.json` (required) – supplies artifact templates and review
    metadata.
  - `simulation_config.json` (optional) – overrides iteration counts, phases,
    and the backward-compatibility mode. Without it the script falls back to a
    single macro iteration.
- The script installs `python-docx`, `openai>=1.77`, and `nltk`; it also
  bootstraps NLTK resources via `ensure_nltk_resources()` before the simulation
  starts.
- Successful runs create the CSV, DOCX, and TXT outputs listed above and offer
  them for download inside Colab. Preserve these files verbatim inside
  `legacy/`—only the `legacy/documentation/` subdirectory is mutable.
